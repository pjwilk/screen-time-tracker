# Mason's Screen Time Tracker — How It Works

## The Deal

You start with **3 hours (180 minutes)** of screen time every day. Your actual screen time depends on your grades and missing assignments. Right now you're at about **1 hour 35 minutes** — here's why, and how to get it back up.

---

## How Screen Time Is Calculated

### You start at 180 minutes. Then:

**You LOSE time for:**
| Problem | Penalty |
|---------|---------|
| Each missing assignment | **-5 min** |
| Each class with a D | **-10 min** |
| Each class with an F | **-20 min** |

**You EARN bonus time for:**
| Achievement | Bonus |
|-------------|-------|
| Zero missing assignments (all classes) | **+30 min** |
| Raising a class by a letter grade | **+10 min per class** |
| Each class with an A | **+5 min** |

**The minimum is 15 minutes** — you always get at least that.

## Your Current Situation

| Class | Grade | Missing | Impact |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|
| Algebra 1 S2 | C (70.6%) | 3 | -15 min |
| Art 2 | B (84.25%) | 1 | -5 min |
| Biology 2 | D (61.23%) | 4 | -20 min + -10 min (D penalty) |
| Concert Choir | A (100%) | 0 | +5 min (A bonus!) |
| English 2 | B (84%) | 2 | -10 min |
| Mil Sci I | F (49.5%) | 2 | -10 min + -20 min (F penalty) |

**Your math right now:**
```
  180  (baseline)
-  60  (12 missing assignments × 5)
-  10  (Biology D)
-  20  (Mil Sci F)
+   5  (Concert Choir A)
= 95 minutes (1h 35m)
```

## How To Get Your Full 3 Hours Back (and more)

Here's exactly what happens when you take action:

### Step 1: Turn in missing assignments
Every assignment you turn in gives you **+5 minutes back**. Turn in all 12 and you get:
- **+60 minutes** back from removing penalties
- **+30 minute bonus** for having zero missing assignments
- That alone gets you to **185 minutes — over 3 hours**

### Step 2: Bring up Biology (D → C)
Get Biology to 70% or above and you:
- Remove the **-10 min D penalty**
- Earn a **+10 min improvement bonus**
- That's **+20 minutes**

### Step 3: Bring up Mil Sci (F → D, then D → C)
Get Mil Sci to 60% or above (D) and you:
- Reduce the penalty from **-20 min to -10 min**
- Earn a **+10 min improvement bonus**

Get it to 70%+ (C) and the penalty goes away completely with another improvement bonus.

### The Dream Scenario
All A's, zero missing assignments:
```
  180  (baseline)
+  30  (zero missing bonus)
+  30  (6 classes × 5 min A bonus)
= 240 minutes (4 hours!)
```

## The Bottom Line

| Action | Time You Get Back |
|--------|-------------------|
| Turn in 1 missing assignment | +5 min |
| Turn in ALL missing assignments | +90 min (60 back + 30 bonus) |
| Raise a class by one letter grade | +10 min |
| Get an A in any class | +5 min per class |
| Keep Concert Choir at an A | Already earning you +5 min |

**The fastest way to more screen time:** turn in those missing assignments. Each one is worth 5 minutes, and clearing them all gets you a 30-minute bonus on top.

Good luck. You got this.
